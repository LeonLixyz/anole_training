Show that \\(C E\\) \\(=F D\\).\n<image>', 'input_img_paths': ['formatted_data/images/problem_0_1.jpg'], 'label_text': "THOUGHT 0: The problem asks us to prove the equality of two line segments, CE and FD. We are given a circle with center O and diameter AB. EF is a chord of this circle. AC and BD are perpendiculars drawn from the endpoints of the diameter (A and B) to the line containing the chord EF. The points C, E, F, D lie on this line. The diagram provided in the question illustrates this setup.\n\nTHOUGHT 1: To relate the segments CE and FD, it seems useful to involve the center of the circle, O, and its relationship with the chord EF and the diameter AB. A standard construction in circle geometry is to draw a perpendicular from the center to a chord. Let's draw OM perpendicular to the line segment CD (which contains the chord EF), with M being the foot of the perpendicular on CD. This construction might help relate the midpoint properties of the diameter and the chord. Let's visualize this.\n\n<image>\n\nTHOUGHT 2: The image now shows the line segment OM, perpendicular to the line CDEF at point M. From the problem statement, we know AC ⊥ CD and BD ⊥ CD. Since AC, OM, and BD are all perpendicular to the same line CD, they must be parallel to each other: AC || OM || BD.\n\nTHOUGHT 3: We have three parallel lines (AC, OM, BD) intersected by two transversals, AB and CD. Since AB is the diameter and O is the center, O is the midpoint of AB (AO = OB). According to the midpoint theorem applied to the trapezoid ACDB (or by properties of parallel lines intercepting transversals), if a line segment (OM) parallel to the bases (AC and BD) passes through the midpoint (O) of one non-parallel side (AB), it must intersect the other non-parallel side (CD) at its midpoint (M). Therefore, M is the midpoint of CD, which means CM = MD. Let's denote this as equation (1).\n\nTHOUGHT 4: Now consider the relationship between the center O, the chord EF, and the perpendicular OM. A fundamental property of circles states that a perpendicular drawn from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord. Since OM ⊥ EF, M must be the midpoint of the chord EF. Therefore, EM = MF. Let's denote this as equation (2).\n\nTHOUGHT 5: We have established two equalities: CM = MD (1) and EM = MF (2). Our goal is to prove CE = FD. Looking at the diagram, we can express the segment CM as the sum of CE and EM (CM = CE + EM). Similarly, we can express MD as the sum of MF and FD (MD = MF + FD).\n\nTHOUGHT 6: Substituting these expressions into equation (1) (CM = MD), we get: CE + EM = MF + FD. Now, using equation (2) (EM = MF), we can substitute MF for EM in the equation: CE + MF = MF + FD. Subtracting MF from both sides gives us CE = FD. Alternatively, we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1): CM - EM = MD - MF. From the diagram, CM - EM represents the length of segment CE, and MD - MF represents the length of segment FD. Therefore, CE = FD.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: Draw \\(O M \\perp E F\\) at M. Since \\(A C \\perp E F\\) and \\(B D \\perp E F\\), we have \\(A C // O M // B D\\). Because O is the midpoint of the diameter AB (\\(A O = O B\\)), M must be the midpoint of CD (by the midpoint theorem for trapezoids or properties of parallel lines and transversals). Thus, \\(C M = M D\\) (1). Also, since OM is perpendicular to the chord EF from the center O, OM bisects the chord EF. Thus, \\(E M = M F\\) (2). Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get \\(C M - E M = M D - M F\\). From the diagram, \\(C M - E M = C E\\) and \\(M D - M F = F D\\). Therefore, \\(C E = F D\\).", 'label_img_paths': ['formatted_data/images/reasoning_0_1.jpg'], 'task': 'reasoning', 'train_task': 'interleaved_reasoning', 'idx': 0}

We are given that chord AB = chord AC = 12. This means triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle. In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal, so ∠ABC = ∠ACB. Let's denote this angle measure as α. We are also given that chord AD intersects chord BC at point E, and the length AE = 8. The diagram [problem_image_1] illustrates this geometric setup.\n\nTHOUGHT 1: To find the length of AD, we need to establish a relationship between the known lengths (AB, AC, AE) and the unknown length AD. Connecting points B and D might help create triangles that involve these segments and allow us to use properties of angles in a circle. Let's add the chord BD to the diagram and mark the equal angles ∠ABC and ∠ACB as α.\n\n\n\nTHOUGHT 2: The updated diagram  now includes chord BD. We can observe angles subtended by arcs. Angles subtended by the same arc at the circumference are equal. Both ∠ACB and ∠ADB subtend the arc AB. Since we established ∠ACB = α, it follows that ∠ADB = α.\n\nTHOUGHT 3: Now let's examine triangles ΔABE and ΔADB.\nIn ΔABE: We have ∠ABE = ∠ABC = α.\nIn ΔADB: We have ∠ADB = α.\nBoth triangles share the angle ∠BAE (which is the same as ∠BAD).\nSince two angles of ΔABE (∠BAE and ∠ABE=α) are equal to two angles of ΔADB (∠BAD and ∠ADB=α), the triangles ΔABE and ΔADB are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion.\n\nTHOUGHT 4: Because ΔABE ~ ΔADB, the ratios of their corresponding sides must be equal. We can match the sides opposite the equal angles:\n- Side opposite ∠AEB in ΔABE corresponds to side opposite ∠ABD in ΔADB.\n- Side opposite ∠ABE (α) in ΔABE is AE.\n- Side opposite ∠ADB (α) in ΔADB is AB.\n- Side opposite ∠BAE in ΔABE is BE.\n- Side opposite ∠BAD in ΔADB is BD.\n- The sides containing the angle ∠BAE are AB and AE in ΔABE, and AD and AB in ΔADB.\nThe ratio of corresponding sides gives: AE / AB = AB / AD = BE / BD.\n\nTHOUGHT 5: We are interested in finding AD. Using the first part of the proportion: AE / AB = AB / AD. We know AE = 8 and AB = AC = 12. Substituting these values gives: 8 / 12 = 12 / AD.\n\nTHOUGHT 6: Now we solve the equation for AD. Cross-multiplying gives 8 * AD = 12 * 12, which simplifies to 8 * AD = 144. Dividing both sides by 8, we get AD = 144 / 8 = 18.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 18 <image>", 'label_img_paths': ['formatted_data/images/reasoning_313_1.jpg'], 'task': 'reasoning', 'train_task': 'interleaved_reasoning', 'idx': 30}

Show that \\(A D\\) bisects \\(B E\\).\n<image>', 'input_img_paths': ['formatted_data/images/problem_262_1.jpg'], 'label_text': "THOUGHT 0: The problem asks us to prove that the line segment AD bisects the line segment BE within triangle ABC. We are given the positions of points E and D: E is the midpoint of side AC, and D is a point on side BC such that BD is one-third the length of BC. The provided image shows the triangle and these points. Let P be the point where AD and BE intersect. Our goal is to show that P is the midpoint of BE, meaning BP = PE.\n\nTHOUGHT 1: To relate the segments and prove the bisection, we can use properties of midpoints and parallel lines. A common strategy is to construct an auxiliary line that helps create triangles where we can apply the Midpoint Theorem or similar theorems. Let's introduce a point F as the midpoint of the segment DC. Connecting E and F might reveal useful relationships, particularly within triangle ADC and potentially triangle BEF. Let's visualize this construction.\n\n<image>\n\nTHOUGHT 2: The image now shows point F as the midpoint of DC and the line segment EF. Consider triangle ADC. By definition, E is the midpoint of AC and F is the midpoint of DC. According to the Midpoint Theorem, the line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length. Therefore, in triangle ADC, EF is parallel to AD (EF // AD) and EF = (1/2)AD.\n\nTHOUGHT 3: Now let's examine the relationships on the side BC. We are given BD = (1/3)BC. Since F is the midpoint of DC, DF = FC = (1/2)DC. We also know that BC = BD + DC. Substituting BD = (1/3)BC gives BC = (1/3)BC + DC, which implies DC = BC - (1/3)BC = (2/3)BC. Now we can find the length of DF: DF = (1/2)DC = (1/2)(2/3)BC = (1/3)BC. So, we have found that BD = (1/3)BC and DF = (1/3)BC. This means BD = DF. Therefore, D is the midpoint of the segment BF.\n\nTHOUGHT 4: Let's focus on triangle BEF. We know that D is the midpoint of side BF (since BD = DF). The point P lies on BE and also on AD. Since EF // AD, and P is on AD, we have EF // PD. So, in triangle BEF, the line segment PD starts from D, the midpoint of BF, and is parallel to the side EF. By the Converse of the Midpoint Theorem (or properties related to lines parallel to a side of a triangle intersecting another side), the line PD must bisect the side BE. This means that P is the midpoint of BE.\n\nTHOUGHT 5: We have established that P, the intersection point of AD and BE, is the midpoint of BE. This means BP = PE. Therefore, the line segment AD bisects the line segment BE.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: Let P be the intersection of AD and BE. Let F be the midpoint of DC.\nIn \\(\\triangle ADC\\), E is the midpoint of AC and F is the midpoint of DC. By the Midpoint Theorem, EF // AD and \\(EF = \\frac{1}{2} AD\\).\nWe are given \\(BD = \\frac{1}{3} BC\\). Since F is the midpoint of DC, \\(DF = FC = \\frac{1}{2} DC\\).\nAlso, \\(DC = BC - BD = BC - \\frac{1}{3} BC = \\frac{2}{3} BC\\).\nSo, \\(DF = \\frac{1}{2} DC = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} BC \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} BC\\).\nThus, \\(BD = DF = \\frac{1}{3} BC\\), which means D is the midpoint of BF.\nNow consider \\(\\triangle BEF\\). D is the midpoint of BF. Since P lies on AD and EF // AD, we have PD // EF.\nBy the Converse of the Midpoint Theorem applied to \\(\\triangle BEF\\), the line segment PD starting from the midpoint D of BF and parallel to EF must bisect the side BE. Therefore, P is the midpoint of BE.\nSince P is the intersection of AD and BE, and P is the midpoint of BE, AD bisects BE.", 'label_img_paths': ['formatted_data/images/reasoning_262_1.jpg'], 'task': 'reasoning', 'train_task': 'interleaved_reasoning', 'idx': 7}
